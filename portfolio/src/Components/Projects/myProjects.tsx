      <h2>Habit Tracker (WIP)</h2>
      <p>
        I'm currently developing a web app that will allow users to insert their
        daily habits, which will provide insight as to why they may be feeling a
        certain way. The app will also provide positive habits that the user can
        work on developing within themselves, as well as research driven
        instructions on how to develop these habits. There will also be a
        calendar system that allows for users to view past logs and see how
        their habits have affected their mood over time.

      <h2>Valorant Patchnotes Bot</h2>
      <p>
        I developed a discord bot that webscrapes the Valorant patchnotes page
        and posts them in a designated discord channel whenever a new patch is
        released.

      <h2>Ohio Eclipse Web App</h2>
      <p>
        During my first ever hackathon in 2024, I developed a web application
        that obtained the user's location, and provided routes to cities based
        in Ohio that had the best viewing experience for the 2024 solar eclipse.
