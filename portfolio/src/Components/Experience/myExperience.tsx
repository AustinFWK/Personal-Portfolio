      <h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>
      <p>
        I was fortunate to be part of my universities undergraduate Data Science
        reseach program, where we teamed up with executives from Fortune500
        company TA to develop a software solution to their online review crisis.
        We engineered a full stack web app that allowed TA to upload csv files
        of their online customer reviews, which we then analyzed using the
        Ollama AI model mistral. This analysis provided an oversight of the
        performance of each selected district/site, allowing for targeted
        improvements and strategies to enhance customer satisfaction.
